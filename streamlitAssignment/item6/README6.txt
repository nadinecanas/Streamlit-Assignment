This Streamlit app integrates OpenCV with a web-based UI to display real-time video captured from the user's webcam. In the sidebar, users can interactively adjust Canny edge detection thresholds to control the intensity of the filter applied to the video stream. A checkbox allows toggling the filter on or off, letting users compare the raw and processed frames. The app mirrors the video feed for a more intuitive, selfie-like view by flipping the frames horizontally. It also includes a snapshot button that captures the current frame and saves it locally with a timestamped filename. The app uses st.image() to display the video frames and maintains a live feed without freezing the Streamlit interface, making it a lightweight tool for basic real-time computer vision tasks.
